This report delves into analysis of Head and neck squamous cancer.
Instructions to run the code:
#Requirements:
R , C++, R studio, Python

The code is available in the clean_data.R file. In this we have compared the mutations as obtained on TCGA dataset from the dN/dS package developed by authors of the paper " Universal Patterns of Selection in Cancer and Somatic Tissues" and our analysis which involves calculating the non synonymous and synonymous mutations of the coding mutations and calculating the dN/dS values for the genes from that. The comparisions of the dN/dS values are done through t-test, z-test, and chi-squeared test in the code. The plot "Chart (1).png" shows the distribution of the dN/dS values for the genes where infinite values have been excluded.
